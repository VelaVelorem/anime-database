# AniScope - Anime Database üéå

Welcome to my **Anime Database** project! As an anime fan, I wanted to create a place to explore popular anime that‚Äôs currently airing, using data pulled directly from the Jikan Anime API. This app was also a personal milestone, as it allowed me to dive deeper into API integration, state management, and experimenting with Tailwind CSS for responsive design.

By using the Jikan API, I was able to bring live anime data into the app, showcasing titles, genres, episode counts, and more.
